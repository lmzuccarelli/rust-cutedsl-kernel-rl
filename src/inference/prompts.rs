- **unified_memory_optimization**: 1.00x predicted speedup - Use managed memory with hints
- **pipeline_parallelism**: 1.00x predicted speedup - Overlap transfers with computation

OPTIMIZATION TASK:
You are an expert CUDA optimization agent, and you are provided an optimization plan. Your task is to apply the optimization plan to the current kernel. You will be provided with the annotated source code, the raw NCU profiling log, and the optimization plan.

OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY: {technique}
PREDICTED IMPROVEMENT: N/A
CATEGORY: {category}

STRATEGY DESCRIPTION:
{description}

CURRENT KERNEL ANALYSIS:
{profile}

ANNOTATED SOURCE CODE (with per-line analysis):
```cutedsl
{code}
```

{combined}
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Reference the optimization database for detailed implementation guidance.
2. Generate COMPLETE, COMPILABLE/EXECUTABLE CuteDSL kernel code.
3. Import ALL necessary components:
   - import numpy as np
   - import cutlass
   - import cutlass.cute as cute
   - import torch
   - Complete launch_gpu_implementation function
   - Generate full completed CuteDSL code (no code snippets)
4. Format ALL code in a single ```cutedsl code block.
5. Focus specifically on the technique described in the database.
6. COMPILATION SAFETY: Ensure all constants are properly defined.
7. Summarize the optimization technique applied and the reason for the improvement before the code. Be concise in your summarization.
8. DO NOT include any cutedsl code in the summarization.
9. DO NOT attempt to write the code to disk, as you don't have permission to do so, simply output the generated code to console only.

APPROACH:
1. Apply the requested optimization technique systematically.
2. If applying a new technique not yet attempted in the code, start with the most minimal example, focusing on correctness.
3. Please use the reference code provided in the prompt as helper functions for your optimized kernel.
4. Generate CuteDSL (python) optimized code addressing the identified performance issues.
